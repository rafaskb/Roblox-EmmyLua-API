# Roblox EmmyLua API

This repository contains the Roblox Lua API in the EmmyLua format, allowing autocompletion, type safety, and awareness of custom global variables outside of Roblox Studio.

The API can be found in the `api` folder, and the script to generate the automatic API is in `src/main.lua`.
